# LINC
LINC - Lightweight Interprocess Networking and Communication Library for modern C++.

LINC is a C++ library designed to provide lightweight and efficient interprocess communication (IPC) on a local machine. It aims to simplify and streamline communication between processes running on the same system, enabling seamless data exchange and collaboration.

Features:

- Lightweight: LINC focuses on minimal resource consumption and low overhead, allowing for efficient communication between processes without unnecessary performance penalties.

- Easy-to-Use API: LINC provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for developers to integrate interprocess communication into their applications. The library abstracts away the complexities of IPC mechanisms, allowing developers to focus on their core logic.

- Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication: LINC supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns. Developers can choose between blocking calls for synchronous communication or non-blocking calls for asynchronous communication, depending on their application requirements.

- Multiple IPC Mechanisms: LINC supports multiple IPC mechanisms, including shared memory, pipes, and message queues. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable mechanism for their specific use case.

- Event-Driven Architecture: LINC utilizes an event-driven architecture, enabling efficient handling of incoming messages and notifications. Developers can register callbacks or event handlers to respond to specific events or data arrivals.

- Built-in Services:
    - Launcher: LINC provides a built-in launcher service that allows for easy process management and launching of other processes within the local machine.
    - Event Center: LINC includes an event center service that provides centralized event management and distribution across processes.
    - Lightweight Key-Value Cache: LINC offers a lightweight key-value cache service, allowing processes to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: LINC is designed to be cross-platform, supporting major operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This ensures that applications built with LINC can run seamlessly on different platforms.

Building LINC:

To build LINC library using CMake, follow these steps:

1. Clone the LINC repository from [GitHub link].

2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`.

3. Generate the build files: `cmake ..`.

4. Build the library: `cmake --build .`.

5. Optionally, run the tests: `ctest`.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation included in the library.
